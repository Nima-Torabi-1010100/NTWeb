**Nima Torabi - Personal Website and Portfolio**

This is my personal website and portfolio where I share some of the projects I’ve worked on in programming and web development. You’ll find examples of my work with ASP.NET, C#, and SQL. I built this site to show my skills, share a bit about my experience, and connect with others who are into building cool web stuff too. Hope you find something interesting here!
